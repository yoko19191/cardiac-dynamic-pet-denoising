# Exploration of self-supervised deep denoising methods of Dynamic PET Image

## Overview

PET (Positron Emission Tomography) is an advanced cardiac imaging modality for studying cardiac functionality and blood flow dynamics. This project aims to explore the impact of various sub-supervised denoising techniques on Cardiac Dynamic PET images to optimize image clarity and analytical accuracy.
